# AI Squat Tracker (Capstone Project)

Senior capstone project at CU Boulder.  
Real-time squat tracking system using computer vision + machine learning.  
The goal: give live feedback on squat form to improve safety and performance.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time pose detection with **MediaPipe** + **OpenCV**
- **FastAPI** backend with health check endpoint
- Live webcam demo for pose landmark tracking
- Model training with **YOLOv8** for barbell detection and rep analysis
- Visualized training metrics (loss curves, precision, recall, mAP)

---

## ðŸ“Š Training Results
Example from our first trained YOLOv8 model:
